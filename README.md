# Self-Assessment: Onion Architecture, MVC, and Web API (.NET Core) with Bottlenecks (Encountered) Conceptual Understanding:

1. <b> Onion Architecture </b>
   <br>-Yes
   
2. <b> MVC Pattern </b>
   <br>-Slight Yes, Slight No
   
3. <b> Web API </b>
   <br>-Slight Yes, Slight No

# Application & Bottlenecks:  Onion Architecture:

1. <b>Benefits</b>
   <br>-Organized

2. <b>Bottlenecks</b>
   <br>- Personal bottleneck, not knowing what to do next or how to start

# MVC

1. <b>Components</b>
   - Model, the logic
   - View, representing the logic
   - Controller, connection of Model and View, process user input into actions performed by Model and View

2. <b>Bottlenecks</b>
   - Yes but just personal matter (e.g., not know what I am doing XD)
  

# Web API

1. <b>Differences</b>
   <br>Traditional
   - use for server-side rendering of html
   <br>API
   - use to enable connection from software app to web
